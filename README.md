# ISM6225_DIS_Group5
This project is implemented as a result of Assignment 5 of Distributed Information Systems ISM 6225 course.
<br>We have designed an MVC Active website based on tracking crimes occuring across USA. It encompasses the basic CRUD operations( Create, Read, Update, Delete) that we perform on the SQL databases.

## About Crime Tracker-
Crime Tracker is designed to give you as much live information on crime statistics as possible and provides you with the exact information you need by giving you the provision to search for the crime types based on location. We have also provided functionality to look up the details based on the year the crime was committed. Our database has a collection of relevant and live data from several national agencies.

## Project Entities-
*Crime Results*- This entity holds the reponse of the API that has the data of the count of crimes in each state, year of crime, the state in which it occured and the population.
<br>
*Agency*- This entity has the data of Agency level SRS crime.
